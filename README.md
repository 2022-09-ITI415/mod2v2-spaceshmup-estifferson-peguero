My goal here was to start the game of slow, which is why I slightly increased the delay of the blaster shots to .25 from .2. Once the player got going I wanted them to feel like they could just kill anything. This lead me to create two new weapon types "HeatRay" and "Beam" that would make it pretty easy for players to defeat anything in sight. Two new enemies were introduced who follow a similar movement style to enemy_1. I made sure that both the new enemy types were hard to hit, and is why the new weapons will shine.

Full Changes:

Spread:

Increased from 3 shots to 5 shots

Blaster:

Delay between shots at 0.25 from 0.2
Fire red blasts instead of white

Added two new enemies, and weapons
